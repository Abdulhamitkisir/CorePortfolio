Hello Everyone! 👋

I’ve completed the training course "Let's Develop a Dynamic Portfolio with Admin Panel with Asp.Net Core Part 1-2" on Udemy, which is available for free under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ at M&Y Software Education Academy Consultancy. This was my first project using .NET Core!

🚀 Technologies Used:

💻 Asp.Net Core 6.0: A powerful framework for building modern web applications.
🗄️ MSSQL Server: A widely-used system for managing databases.
🔍 LINQ: A powerful language for querying and manipulating data.
📦 Entity Framework (Code First): An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used for database operations.
⚙️ View Components: For page management and dynamic content creation.
📩 Message Sending Feature: Enables message sending in the user panel.
✅ To-Do List: A task list where users can mark tasks as completed.
📬 Incoming Messages: Messages from users are displayed as pop-ups.
📱 Social Media Accounts: Allows editing of social media profiles.
🖥️ User Interface: The UI displays sections such as "About Me", "Places I Work", "My Projects", "My Skills", and "References". 
Dynamic statistics and social media accounts are also presented visually. Users can communicate with the admin via the message feature.

🔑 Admin Panel: The admin panel supports all CRUD operations. Admins can create and mark tasks in the to-do list,
   manage incoming messages displayed as pop-ups, and view a detailed statistics section that is more extensive than the user panel.
